## IoT Provisioning Tool

The [IoT Provisioning Tool](http://www.microchip.com/mymicrochip/filehandler.aspx?ddocname=en1001525) is a tool offered by Microchip to easily provision the AWS variant of the PIC & AVR IoT Boards. It handles all the cryptography and interactions with all Microchip PIC & AVR IoT Boards.

The IoT Provisioning Tool is a command-line utility and must be run from a terminal (e.g. cmd.exe for Windows速, Terminal for MacOS速 & Linux速). The following list contains some typical use cases for the tool:

- Provision a board with your own AWS Project:
  - `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m jitr` (using JITR)
  - `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m mar` (using MAR)
- Provision a board with the AWS Sandbox:
  - `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m sandbox`
- Provision a board with a specifiec firmware:
  - `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m jitr -app myfirm.hex` (using JITR)
  - `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m mar -app myfirm.hex` (using MAR)
- Set Wi-Fi credentials:
  - `./iotprovision-bin -auth wpa-psk -ssid mywifi -psk password`

> Note: Using the tool is not the only way to install Wi-Fi速 credentials and custom firmware. See [AVR-IoT WA Quick Start Guide](http://microchip.com/DS30010218).

For a complete description of what the tool can do, run `./iotprovision-bin --help`. The following is a printout of that command:

```

The `-m mar` and `-m jitr` options of the provisioning tool are used to authenticate a board with a non-sandbox AWS project. When running the provisioning tool for the first time using either of these options, the provisioning tool connects to AWS via the command line interface (AWS CLI) and sets up the cloud for successful device authentication. The details of the process differ somewhat for MAR and JITR, and we will therefore cover each method separately.

## Just-in-time Registration

*Just-in-time registration* is a provisioning method where device certificates are validated the first time they connect to the cloud. Upon connecting, a certificate authority (CA) in AWS checks the validity of the device certificate. If it is found to be valid, both the device's name and its certificate are stored in AWS IoT Core and is used to authenticate device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device communication.

When the `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m jitr` provisioning command is run for the first time, the following happens:

1. A *self-signed* **Certificate Authority** (root-ca.crt) is generated. This is the Root CA.
2. A **Signer CA** (signer-ca.crt) is generated and signed by the Root-CA.
3. A **Device Certificate** (device.crt) is generated and signed by the signer certificate.
4. The **Device Certificate** and **Thing Name** is stored in the IoT Board.
5. The **Signer Certificate** is uploaded to AWS IoT as a CA.

Step 3 and 4 are a bit simplified, as in reality, a [*Certificate Signing Request*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) is performed. All of these certificates and their private keys (except the device certificates) can be found in the folder `.microchip-iot` under the users home directory. See the flowchart below for an illustration of the generation process.

| OS            | Path                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Windows       | %userprofile%\\.microchip-iot |
| Mac and Linux | ~/.microchip-iot              |

![Figure 3 - Provisioning Tool Signing](figures/aws-iot-connections.svg)

The next time the tool runs, it checks for existing certificates in the `.microchip-iot` folder. If nothing is found, it runs through the process described above. If all certificates exist, it does nothing. If a Root CA and Signer CA exist, but the device is unknown, it signs the connected devices certificate with the Signer CA.

After the initial setup, the device's certificate has been signed by the certificate authority that has been uploaded to AWS. When the device is connected to AWS for the first time, the certificate can, therefore, be verified and registered automatically. The *thing*'s name is then also registered and a predefined policy is assigned to the certificate. The authentication of the device for subsequent connections is described in the flowchart below.

![Figure 2 - Provisioning Tool Signing](figures/jitr-flow.svg)

### Setting up JITR in AWS

In AWS, JITR functionality can be obtained using an [*AWS Lambda Function*](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). A Lambda Function is a code snippet that runs without having dedicated resources. Whenever a call to the function is made, AWS allocates resources for the duration of the function call. From the AWS Documentation:

> AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
>
> \- [AWS Documentation - What is AWS Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)

A lambda function is precisely what is needed to implement the loop in the flowchart above. When an unknown device tries to connect using a CA-signed certificate, an MQTT message with the topic `$aws/events/certificates/registered/#` is published. Using an IoT Action (also called a *rule*), these messages are picked up and forwarded to a Lambda Function executing the code found in [jitr_lambda.py](jitr_lambda.py).

> A device is *unknown* if it does not exist in the AWS IoT Thing Registry.

The Lambda Function checks if a policy named `zt_policy` already exists, creating it if not. The device's certificate is linked to the policy and registered in AWS IoT Core. When the devices try to reconnect, it is authenticated. The figure below describes this process.

![Figure 3 - JITR Setup in AWS](figures/jitr-aws-diagram.svg)

A screenshot of the "Forward Signed but Unknown Devices" rule is shown below.

![Figure 4 - IoT Rule Forwarding Signed but Unknown Devices](figures/forward-rule.jpg)

## Multi-account Registration

*Multi-account registration* is a provisioning method where device names and certificates have to be uploaded and registered in AWS before device-to-cloud connectivitiy can be authorized and established. There is not need for an AWS Lambda function using this method, since everything is registered before connecting.

When the `./iotprovision-bin -c aws -m mar` provisioning command is run for the first time, the following happens:

1. A *self-signed* **Certificate Authority** (root-ca.crt) is generated. This is the Root CA.
2. A **Signer CA** (signer-ca.crt) is generated and signed by the Root-CA.
3. A **Device Certificate** (device.crt) is generated and signed by the signer certificate.
4. The **Device Certificate** and **Thing Name** is stored in the IoT Board.
5. The **Device Certificate** and **Thing Name** is uploaded and registered with AWS

The first four steps are similar to the JITR procedures above, and step 3 and 4 are simplified here as well. In reality, a [*Certificate Signing Request*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) is performed. All of these certificates and their private keys (except the device certificates) can be found in the folder `.microchip-iot` under the users home directory.

| OS            | Path                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Windows       | %userprofile%\\.microchip-iot |
| Mac and Linux | ~/.microchip-iot              |

When the above process is complete, the device is authorized to communicate with AWS and there is no need for further registrations upon the first connection.

## Device Permissions in AWS

All devices that interact with an AWS account are registered in the IoT Core Module and are called *things*. A thing has a *certificate* attached to it, which again is connected to a *policy*, which defines the certificates permissions and thus also the things permissions. When a device connects, it provides a certificate and a *thing name*. If the thing with the specified name exists and the certificate is valid, the device is allowed to connect and perform the actions specified in the certificates policy.

**Summarized**: Permissions in AWS, such as connect and send data, are defined by a *policy*. Policies are attached to *certificates*, which are used to authenticate *things* (devices).

### Policy Example

Policies are defined as JSON documents, with one or more *statements*. From the AWS Documentation:

> An AWS IoT Core policy is a JSON document that contains one or more policy statements. Each statement contains:
>
> - Effect, which specifies whether the action is allowed or denied
>
> - Action, which specifies the action the policy is allowing or denying
>
> - Resource, which specifies the resource or resources on which the action is allowed or denied
>
> \- [AWS Documentation - AWS IoT Core Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html)

When using the IoT Provisioning Tool, a policy is generated and added based on the project's properties. An example of this policy can be seen in [policy_example.json](policy_example.json).

## Finding the AWS Resources

The IoT Provisioning Tool sets up the process described above on initial execution, and the resources it sets up can be found in the AWS Console. The resources can be found in the following locations:

- **Certificate**: IoT Core -> Security -> Certificates
- **Certificate Authority**: IoT Core -> Security -> CAs
- **Policies**: IoT Core -> Security -> Policies
- **Things** (Devices): IoT Core -> Manage -> Things
- **JITR Lambda Function**: Lambda -> JITR
